(ns browseragent.browser.live
  "Live view of the agent's *own* browser.

  The library performs no I/O: it formats events and hands them to an
  injected `:emit-fn` host capability (an SSE/WebSocket push on the
  JVM, a `core.async` tap, or a host UI event callback). With
  no `:emit-fn` this is a silent no-op, so headless runs stay pure.

  A real provider pairs this with a screencast: pass a `:screenshot-fn`
  that returns the current frame (CDP `Page.screencast`, a periodic
  capture, or an Anthropic image block) and it rides the same stream
  the user watches — and can interrupt (take-over)."
