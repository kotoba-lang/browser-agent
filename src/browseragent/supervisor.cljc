  "Mixture-of-Agents supervisor as a langgraph StateGraph:

      :delegate → (more steps?) → :delegate → … → :aggregate → END

  For each plan step it routes to a sub-agent (the planner's
  `:assignee`, or an injected `:router` override — cheap model routes,
  strong model handles the hard step), runs it, and records the
  decision + outcome as a `:deleg/*` datom. `:aggregate` synthesizes
  the step results into the final answer, optionally cross-checking
  with an `:aggregator-model` (the MoA factuality pass).

  State channels:
    :plan    the numbered steps (last-write-wins; replan can swap it)
    :cursor  index of the next step
    :results [{:step :assignee :result} …]  (accumulated)
    :done / :result  terminal answer"
