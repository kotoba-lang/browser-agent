  "Runnable demo of a genspark-style run on mocks — no API keys, no
  real browser. Plans a task into web → research → author, delegates
  through the MoA supervisor (the web step drives the agent's owned
  browser), and prints the UI event stream + the Datomic audit trail.

      clojure -M:dev:run            ; (alias wires examples/ + this -main)

  Swap the mock models for `langchain.model/anthropic-model` and the
  `:mock` browser for a Playwright provider to run it for real."
